<h2 id="overview">Project Overview</h2>
<p>The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a borrower will default on their loan. This solution is critical for financial institutions looking to assess credit risk and make more informed lending decisions. By analyzing historical loan data, we train models to predict default probability, thereby improving decision-making in loan approval processes.</p>

<h2 id="techniques-used">Techniques Used</h2>
<p>The project uses a combination of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models. Below are the primary techniques implemented:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Raw data is cleaned and transformed through handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables to make it suitable for modeling.</li>
  <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Comprehensive EDA helps identify trends, distributions, and correlations in the data. This step informs feature selection and engineering, crucial for model performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Selection:</strong> A variety of machine learning algorithms are employed, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Logistic Regression</li>
      <li>Random Forest</li>
      <li>XGBoost</li>
      <li>Decision Trees</li>
    </ul>
  These models are tuned using cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization to improve predictive performance.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> The models are evaluated using metrics such as AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and F1-score. Special attention is given to the imbalanced nature of the dataset, ensuring accurate prediction of loan defaults despite the majority of non-default cases.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="business-impact">Business Impact</h2>
<p>This loan default prediction solution delivers substantial value to financial institutions by improving their risk management and credit decision processes. Key business impacts include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reduced Financial Risk:</strong> By identifying high-risk borrowers, banks and financial institutions can minimize losses from loan defaults and non-performing assets (NPAs).</li>
  <li><strong>Improved Lending Decisions:</strong> Lenders can make more informed and data-driven decisions, optimizing loan approval processes based on predicted risk profiles of applicants.</li>
  <li><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> Automating the default prediction process reduces manual analysis time, enhancing the speed and scalability of loan assessments.</li>
  <li><strong>Better Customer Management:</strong> Institutions can adjust loan terms or implement additional checks for high-risk applicants, fostering better customer relations while managing risk.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>To run the project locally, follow these steps:</p>

<pre>
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   <code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-default-prediction.git</code>

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   <code>cd loan-default-prediction</code>

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
</pre>

<p>Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed along with Jupyter Notebook. You can create a virtual environment to manage dependencies effectively:</p>

<pre>
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# For Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# For MacOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
</pre>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Once the environment is set up, follow these steps to use the project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Jupyter notebook by running the following command in the terminal:
    <pre><code>jupyter notebook LoanDefaultPrediction.ipynb</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>In the notebook, you can follow the steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The notebook includes detailed explanations for each step.</li>
  <li>Once the model is trained, run the prediction section to generate probabilities for loan defaults on the test data.</li>
  <li>You can modify the model parameters or try different algorithms by editing the respective sections of the notebook.</li>
</ol>
